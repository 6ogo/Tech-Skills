# Tech Hub Skills - Agent Guidance

**200+ production-ready AI agent skills organized in a hierarchical multi-agent system.**

## v2.3: Hierarchical Agent Architecture

This workspace uses a high-efficiency **Brainstorm → Plan → Implement** workflow.

### Architecture Components

| File                           | Purpose                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `agents/orchestrator-agent.md` | Master coordinator and primary entry point       |
| `agents/*-lead.md`             | Domain-specific Lead agents (AI, Platform, etc.) |
| `agents/SKILL-REGISTRY.md`     | Lightweight skill index for lazy loading         |
| `agents/ROLE-REGISTRY.md`      | Lightweight role index for lazy loading          |
| `agents/EXECUTION.md`          | Agent coordination and communication protocol    |
| `agents/specialists/`          | 25 Specialist agents loaded on-demand            |

## Workflow Strategy

### 1. Brainstorm (Strategic Analysis)

- Understand core requirements and constraints.
- Identify potential risks (Security, Cost, Tech Debt).
- Compare alternative technical approaches.

### 2. Plan (Lazy Loading)

- Scan `SKILL-REGISTRY.md` for role/skill keywords.
- Select only relevant specialists from `agents/specialists/`.
- Create a milestone-based implementation plan.

### 3. Implement (Validated Execution)

- Load skill files from `skill-docs/` only when executing.
- Reference templates from `templates/` for code implementation.
- Validate each step before proceeding to the next.

## Available Slash Commands

| Command         | Description                           | Target Agent       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `/orchestrator` | Analyze project and coordinate agents | Orchestrator Agent |
| `/ai`           | AI, ML, and Data Science tasks        | AI/ML Lead         |
| `/platform`     | DevOps, SRE, and Cloud Infrastructure | Platform Lead      |
| `/security`     | Security audits and Compliance        | Security Lead      |
| `/data`         | Data Engineering and Governance       | Data Lead          |
| `/product`      | Product Dev, Frontend, and Backend    | Product Lead       |

## Mandatory Rules (Lead Enforcement)

- **Security Lead**: MUST be involved if PII or production deployment is detected.
- **FinOps**: MUST track costs for all cloud resource creation.
- **QA Engineer**: MUST validate all code changes for testing coverage.
- **Data Governance**: MUST be consulted for schema or storage changes.
