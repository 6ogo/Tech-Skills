# Skill Registry - Lightweight Index

**Purpose**: Agents reference this compact index to find skills. Load FULL skill docs ONLY when executing.

## How Agents Use This

```yaml
1. Agent receives task
2. Scan this INDEX for relevant skills (by keyword/trigger)
3. Identify skill IDs needed
4. Load ONLY those skill files when executing
5. Unload after task complete
```

## Loading Protocol

### When task arrives:

```yaml
step_1_scan_keywords:
  action: "Match task keywords to this index"
  context_cost: "~200 tokens (this file only)"

step_2_identify_skills:
  action: "List matching skill IDs"
  example: "Task mentions 'RAG chatbot' → ai-02, ai-04, sa-01"

step_3_load_on_demand:
  action: "Load EXPERT GUIDANCE for the role"
  command: "read_file('.claude/skill-docs/ai-engineer.md')"

step_4_load_details:
  action: "Load DETAILED skill implementation"
  command: "read_file('.claude/roles/ai-engineer/skills/01-prompt-engineering/README.md')"

step_5_execute:
  action: "Apply skill knowledge to task"

step_6_unload:
  action: "Don't retain full skill docs in memory"
  why: "Save context for next task"
```

### What NOT to do:

```yaml
 WRONG: Load all skill files at start
   → Wastes 50,000+ tokens

 WRONG: Keep skill files loaded after use
   → Fills context unnecessarily

 WRONG: Guess skill IDs without checking index
   → May miss relevant skills

 RIGHT: Scan index → identify → load → execute → unload
```

## Agent Responsibilities

### Orchestrator

- Maintains awareness of this index
- Routes to appropriate leads
- Never loads all skills at once

### Lead Agents

- Know their domain's skill files
- Load only when specialists need them
- Coordinate cross-domain loading

### Specialists

- Request specific skills via ID
- Load → Execute → Report → Unload
- Minimize context footprint

---

## Example Flow

```yaml
task: "Build a RAG chatbot with security"

orchestrator:
  1. Scan index for: "RAG", "chatbot", "security"
  2. Match: ai-02, ai-04, sa-01
  3. Route to: @ai-ml-lead, @security-lead

ai_ml_lead:
  1. Load: .claude/skill-docs/ai-engineer.md (Expert checklists)
  2. Load: .claude/roles/ai-engineer/skills/02-rag-pipeline/README.md (Implementation details)
  3. Delegate to @ai-engineer-agent
  4. Execute skills
  5. Unload files

result:
  - Context used: ~1,500 tokens (vs 50,000+ if all loaded)
  - Skills applied: 3 specific skills
  - Knowledge: Expert-level for those 3 skills
```
