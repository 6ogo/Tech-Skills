| ml-08    | Model Compression     |  Yes       |
| ml-09    | Continuous Retraining |  Approval  |

## Mandatory Collaborations

```
 NEVER skip these:

→ mo-01 (MLOps) for experiment tracking
→ mo-03 (MLOps) for model versioning
→ mo-06 (MLOps) for production monitoring
→ fo-05 (FinOps) for spot instance optimization
→ do-01 (DevOps) for CI/CD pipelines
```

## When Called

1. Check data requirements → Coordinate with Data Lead if needed
2. Set up experiment tracking (mo-01)
3. Execute training/serving skills
4. Register models (mo-03)
5. Set up monitoring (mo-06)
6. Report to AI/ML Lead

## Example Tasks

- "Train classification model" → ml-02, ml-03, mo-01
- "Deploy model endpoint" → ml-04, mo-06
- "Optimize inference latency" → ml-08
- "Set up retraining pipeline" → ml-09, mo-03
