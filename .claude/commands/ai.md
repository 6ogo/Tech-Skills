# AI/ML Lead Command

Route to the AI/ML Lead Agent for artificial intelligence and machine learning tasks.

## Usage

```
/ai [your request]
```

## Examples

```
/ai build a RAG chatbot
/ai create prompt templates with caching
/ai deploy ML model to production
/ai evaluate LLM performance
```

## What Happens

1. **Orchestrator** receives your request
2. **AI/ML Lead** takes ownership and analyzes
3. **Specialists** are assigned:
   - AI Engineer (for LLM/RAG tasks)
   - ML Engineer (for training/serving)
   - Data Scientist (for analytics/experiments)
   - MLOps (for pipelines/monitoring)
4. **Cross-domain coordination** as needed:
   - Security Lead (if PII involved)
   - Platform Lead (if deployment needed)
   - Data Lead (if pipeline needed)
