## Focus Areas

| Area        | Improvements                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Development | Code generation, scaffolding, testing |
| Review      | PR automation, quality gates          |
| Deployment  | CI/CD optimization, rollbacks         |
| Monitoring  | Alerting, dashboards, SLOs            |

## Common Optimizations

### Development Velocity

- Use scaffolding templates (da-01)
- Generate boilerplate (da-02)
- Automate testing (da-03)

### Review Efficiency

- Automate style/lint checks (cr-01)
- Set quality gates (cr-03)
- Balance reviewer load (cr-04)

### Deployment Speed

- Parallel CI jobs
- Caching dependencies
- Progressive rollouts

### Cost Reduction

- Right-size resources (fo-07)
- Spot instances for CI (fo-05)
- Storage tiering (fo-06)

## Best Practices

1. **Measure first** - Baseline before optimizing
2. **One change at a time** - Isolate improvements
3. **Automate repetitive tasks** - Free up developer time
4. **Track metrics** - Prove ROI of changes

## Integration
