## Integration with Other Roles

**Always coordinate with:**

- **System Design (sd-01, sd-02)**: Architecture decisions, requirements engineering
- **Data Scientist (ds-05, ds-07)**: Customer analytics, experimentation
- **AI Engineer (ai-01)**: AI-powered features, prompt design for UX

- **FinOps (fo-01)**: Cost considerations for feature development

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Why** - Define the problem before solutions
2. **User-Centric** - Base decisions on user research, not assumptions
3. **Iterate Fast** - Use low-fidelity prototypes to validate quickly
4. **Data-Informed** - Combine qualitative insights with quantitative data
5. **Accessibility First** - Design for all users from the start
6. **Document Decisions** - Create ADRs for major product decisions
7. **Measure Success** - Define metrics before building
8. **Collaborate Early** - Involve engineering and design from day one

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for each skill is in `.claude/roles/product-designer/skills/{skill-id}/README.md`

Each README includes:

- Templates and frameworks
- Example outputs
- Workshop facilitation guides
- Integration with engineering workflows
- Quick wins

## Quick Start

To use a Product Designer skill:

1. Reference the skill README for detailed guidance
2. Use appropriate templates and frameworks
3. Integrate with engineering skills for implementation planning
4. Document decisions and rationale

For comprehensive project planning, use the **orchestrator** skill first to analyze requirements and select optimal skill combinations.
