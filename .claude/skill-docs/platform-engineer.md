- Standardizing infrastructure provisioning
- Managing SLOs and error budgets
- Implementing self-service capabilities

## Integration with Other Roles

**Always coordinate with:**

- **DevOps (do-01, do-02, do-03)**: CI/CD, containers, IaC
- **System Design (sd-04, sd-07)**: HA/DR, observability

## Best Practices

1. **Platform as Product** - Treat platform as a product with users
2. **Golden Paths** - Create easy paths for common tasks
3. **Self-Service** - Minimize tickets, maximize automation
4. **Measure Developer Velocity** - Track DORA metrics
5. **Error Budgets** - Balance reliability with velocity
6. **Documentation** - If it's not documented, it doesn't exist
7. **Feedback Loops** - Regular surveys and office hours
8. **Gradual Rollout** - Test platform changes incrementally

## Documentation

Detailed documentation:

- `platform-engineer/best-practices.md`: Comprehensive guide
- `.claude/roles/platform-engineer/skills/{skill-id}/README.md`: Individual skill documentation
- `platform-engineer/walkthroughs/`: Step-by-step guides

## Quick Start

To use a Platform Engineer skill:

1. Reference the platform-engineer best practices
2. Interview developers to understand pain points
3. Build minimal viable platform (MVP)
4. Measure adoption and satisfaction
5. Iterate based on feedback

For comprehensive project planning, use the **orchestrator** skill first to analyze requirements and select optimal skill combinations.
