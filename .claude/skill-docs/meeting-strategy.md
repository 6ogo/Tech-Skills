## Meeting Preparation Pattern

When preparing for a meeting:

1. **Context Gathering**

   - What is the meeting goal?
   - Who are the attendees? (Management, Technical, Compliance?)

2. **Data Synthesis**

   - Pull latest from `process-kanban`
   - Check `compliance-automation` for status
   - Look at recent commits and PRs

3. **Risk & Security Check**

   - Highlight any red/yellow flags in security
   - Ensure compliance evidence is ready if needed

4. **Strategy & Coaching**
   - Draft the "Story of the Project"
   - Refine speaking points
   - Conduct a "mock Q&A"

## Best Practices

1. **Data-Driven**: Always back claims with board data or commit history.
2. **Security First**: Never present progress without verifying security posture.
3. **Concise Narratives**: Keep executive summaries under 3 paragraphs.
4. **Action-Oriented**: Focus on "What was done" and "What's next".
5. **Continuous Feedback**: Iteratively refine speaking points with the agent.
